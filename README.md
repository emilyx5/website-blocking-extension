# Website Blocker!

This is a Chrome extension that helps users block websites of their choosing while maintaining flexibility, allowing them to temporarily unblock needed sites. Sometimes, distracting websites like YouTube need to be used! 
It's a hassle having to unblock and block on other extensions, and risk clicking into the less educational recommended videos while the ban is lifted, so I wanted to take the chance to **a)** learn how to code one myself, **b)** add some variability/adaptability **c)** get to design the interface to make it more compelling.

## Features:

  # 1. Temporary Access

   When you're on a blocked site, the extension redirects you to a screen with two choices: Close the tab, or proceed. By having this screen available, it deters users from permanently unblocking websites or uninstalling the extension to access their sites (as I have done before..)

   # 2. Tedious Unblock, but not Too Tedious

   If you do wish to proceed to the site, you are met with another screen that confirms your answer, then a final screen with a form that must be filled out before redirecting you to your site.

   By making the process a little bit tedious, I wanted to make users more aware of what they planned to spend their time on. Too often have I found myself mindlessly clicking to YouTube without a goal in mind, and then coming back to reality many videos later, wondering what I was doing.
   It's a common tip in producitivity to always set goals before beginning a work session, and I wanted to promote that mindfulness here. There are many extensions out there with stricter block policies, but my idea was not to create a stronger restriction on users, but to help develop their awareness and discipline.
   
   # 3. Reminders and Time limit
   
   On the same note, the extension forces you to input an estimated time and reminder count. The website will be blocked again after this estimated time limit, after which you are free to repeat the process to extend the unblock duration.
   The reminder count determines how many notifications you'll receive reminding you of your reason for access during the estimated timeframe.
